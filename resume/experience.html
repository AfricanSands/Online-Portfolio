      <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
      <p>Having spent time living in different countries and under different conditions, I am someone that is deeply committed to making a difference in the world. This translates into a desire for self-fulfillment through work that is meaningful, and in an environment where my contribution is valued.</p>
      <p>As a self-motivated, responsible and well-educated individual I bring solutions. My numerous skills and a quick learning ability make me valuable in any dynamic work environment, and my systematic nature makes me meticulous and detail-orientated. As a competitive sportswoman I enjoy an element of risk-taking and love mastering new skills.</p>
      <p>I thrive within a caring team environment and enjoy leading a team, where I bring both the systems and processes, and the human, empathy component into play. Some of the innate skills I can bring to the table are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarity under pressure</li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Lateral thinking</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Education and Qualifications</h2>
        <p>While I have grown up with the Internet (it is only a couple of years younger than me), I have admittedly never really given much thought to the workings behind the technology. That is all about to change. </p>
        <p>I am currently serving in the Royal Navy, and I am about to be let loose into the real world. So I am currently on a quest to start a new career: playing Battleship won't get me very far!</p>
        <p>While I currently live in England, I have also lived in Canada and Africa. My claim to fame (in my head) is that I spent time growing up in a mud hut. Aside from wearing a green jumpsuit to work in the military, I have been a bartender, a research assistant, and a desk-jockey, among others. So it is now time for another change - one which I am incredibly excited about.</p>

        <h2>Work History</h2>
        <p>Having grown up in Africa, I have always enjoyed being active, and I have enjoyed the outdoors. I have competed in numerous sports, some more unusual than others. Some of the activities I enjoy are:</p>
        <ul class="activities">
          <li>Surfing</li>
          <li>Snowboarding</li>
          <li>Wakeboarding</li>
          <li>Rugby</li>
          <li>Hiking</li>
          <li>Mountain biking</li>
          <li>Hanging out with my cat, Gustav</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I do however also enjoy being able to relax. On a rainy day, you can find me reading a book (often a fantasy epic) or playing computer games. My ideal evening out is at the local pub, where the conversation is warm and the beer is cold.</p>
