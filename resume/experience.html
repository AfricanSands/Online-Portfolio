        <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
        <p>Having spent time living in different countries and under different conditions, I am someone that is deeply committed to making a difference in the world. This translates into a desire for self-fulfillment through work that is meaningful, and in an environment where my contribution is valued.</p>
        <p>As a self-motivated, responsible and well-educated individual I bring solutions. My numerous skills and a quick learning ability make me valuable in any dynamic work environment, and my systematic nature makes me meticulous and detail-orientated. As a competitive sportswoman I enjoy an element of risk-taking and love mastering new skills.</p>
        <p>I thrive within a caring team environment and enjoy leading a team, where I bring both the systems and processes, and the human, empathy component into play. Some of the innate skills I can bring to the table are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarity under pressure</li>
          <li>Communication</li>
          <li>Lateral thinking</li>
        </ul>
