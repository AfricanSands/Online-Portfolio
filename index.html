        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am currently serving in the Royal Navy, and I am about to be let loose into the real world. So I am currently on a quest to start a new career: playing Battleship won't get me very far!</p>
        <p>While I currently live in England, I have also lived in Canada and Africa. My claim to fame (in my head) is that I spent time growing up in a mud hut. Aside from wearing a green jumpsuit to work in the military, I have been a bartender, a research assistant, and a desk-jockey, among others. So it is now time for another change - one which I am incredibly excited about.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am completing my TechDegree in Front End Development as the beginning of my route to becoming a Full Stack Developer. There are numerous skills that I want to learn, including:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am hoping to work with a company who I can learn and grow with, greating exciting content and developing innovative and unusual software as well.</p>
        <p>Alongside learning all of these new and exciting skills, I am in the process of completing my MSc in Mental Health Sciences, in order to develop my analytical and research skills.</p>
